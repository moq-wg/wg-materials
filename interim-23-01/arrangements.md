## Getting to the office

### By Transit

The South Lake Union
[Streetcar](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/getting-around/transit/streetcar/south-lake-union-line)
runs from downtown to Lake Union Park, which is an 8 minute walk from the
building.

There are also bus options, the closest stops are
[#40](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro/schedules-maps/hastop/040.aspx)
(Westlake and Highland) and
[#62](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro/schedules-maps/hastop/062.aspx)
(Dexter & Aloha – take the stairs at Highland Drive to get down from Dexter to
Westlake).

Unfortunately, there isn’t a Link Light Rail stop near the office.

### Ride Share

Uber/Lyft operate in the city.  The preferred drop-off location is on [Highland
Drive](https://www.google.com/maps/place/47%25C2%25B037'47.1%2522N+122%25C2%25B020'28.7%2522W/@47.6297476,-122.3418443,19.02z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d47.6297371!4d-122.3413065).

There are scooter/bike share companies that operate in Seattle.

### By Car

There is paid parking in the building.  There are two garage entrances but only
the Westlake Avenue entrance is for visitors.  There is another paid public
parking garage less than a block South, on 8th Avenue N.

### By Bike

There are bike racks in the Westlake Avenue garage.  Unfortunately, there have been bike thefts recently so bring a big lock.

## Meeting Time

Doors will open around 9am, with meetings starting at 9:30.  We’ll break for
lunch around 12:00.  Lunch is not provided but there are restaurants in the
area.  The afternoon session will resume from ~1:00pm and will break before 5pm.
